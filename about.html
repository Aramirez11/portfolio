    <div id="p2"></div>Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It is caused by the bacterium
    Bordetella pertussis. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After
    cough fits, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breaths, which result in a “whooping” sound. Pertussis can
    affect people of all ages, but can be very serious, even deadly, for babies less than a year old.</p></div>
